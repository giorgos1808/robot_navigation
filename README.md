# Robot Navigation

Welcome to the repository dedicated to implementing a controller for guiding a robot through an unknown environment towards its goal. The objective is to navigate the robot through a set of obstacles, with the ultimate goal defined by the projection of a luminaire (lamp) on the ground.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation for a robot guidance controller that addresses the challenges of maneuvering in an unfamiliar environment. The primary focus is on efficiently guiding the robot through obstacles to reach its destination, pinpointed by the projection of a luminaire on the ground.

## Key Features

<ol>
  <li>Obstacle Navigation</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The controller is designed to guide the robot through a dynamic environment with obstacles.</li>
    <li>Efficient path planning algorithms are employed to navigate the robot around obstacles in real-time.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Goal Recognition</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The goal is defined by the projection of a luminaire on the ground, serving as a unique and identifiable destination for the robot.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>

## Note

To run the program, you have to execute the LightSensorRobot.java file.

Feel free to explore, run the program, and observe the robot's successful navigation through the unknown environment.
